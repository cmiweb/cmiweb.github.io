# All clothing designs are hand drawn
This is a project that I am working on constantly. I enjoy creating beautifully made interfaces and providing a smooth and easy user experience.

uovoc is a website created and maintained by me, Claudiu Ionita.

With the help of my girlfriend we founded uovoc, a baby clothes e-commerce store where we put our creativity into unique designs for children.
